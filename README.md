## Running the backend scripts

To run the backend server, you need to activate the environment using

 - On Mac/Linux:

```bash
venv/bin/activate
```

 - On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Now you need to install your backend dependencies before running your backend server using

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To save any new dependencies, you can run

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Running the frontend

Simply run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to run the frontend in development mode.
