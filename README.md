To run the backend server, you need to create a virtual environment first using

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

You can now activate the environment using
 - On Mac/Linux:

```bash
venv/bin/activate
```

 - On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Now you need to install our backend dependencies before running our backend server using

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

To save any new dependencies, you can run

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
